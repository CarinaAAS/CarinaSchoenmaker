Interesting ecological variables: 


- species interactions [5]
- temperature [1]
- body size [4] Lineage Diversification Rate [15]
- binary characters such as birth/death [2] 
- sexual system
- dispersal ability 
- habitat (loss) [3]
- Climate change: involving CO2-equivalence greenhouse gasses, temperature, changing environment, water, humidity, sea level, composition of the atmosphere [7] [9]

Global warming and its effect on evolution. 


Climate change concerns many different aspects, such as the ones listed above. Furthermore, these aspects all have concequences that may lead to variation of genomes, for example; temperature change may lead to shifts of groups of animals which leads to different species interactions.  [8]

Effect of climate change on evolution: 
Evidence for genetic changes in response to climate change — recent case studies [6]

 To begin to understand the limits to population persistence, we present a simple evolutionary model for the critical rate of environmental change beyond which a population must decline and go extinct. We use this model to highlight the major determinants of extinction risk in a changing environment, and identify research needs for improved predictions based on projected changes in environmental variables. [10]
 
  The challenges are to understand when evolution will occur and to identify potential evolutionary winners as well as losers, such as species lacking adaptive capacity living near physiological limits. given a certain selection pressure and trait heritability [11]
  
 
Evolutionary models were explicitly considered in this study of the extinction risk of lizard species to climate change. [12]
