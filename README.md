Bachelor thesis progress / biological analysis

Interesting ecological variables: 
- Something involving CO2, earth temperature, greenhouse gasses, changing environment 
- species interactions [5]
- temperature [1]
- body size [4]
- binary characters such as birth/death [2]
- sexual system
- dispersal ability 
- habitat (loss) [3]


_!Nice explanation of the principle!_
The relationship between clade size and time (box 1)
Testing which environmental and species attributes influence diversification rates: comparing the number of species in clades that differ in these attributes.  Different methods: Sister clades/independent clades analyses/single phylogenetic trees/lineage-through-time plots/[1]
